# Greencell Internship Assignment 🚀

This repository contains my data analysis and visualization submission for the **Greencell Internship (Jan 2025)**. 

## 📌 Overview
The assignment involves:
- Data visualization in **Excel**
- Data analysis & visualization in **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Identifying trends, peaks, and voltage drop patterns

## 📊 Data Visualization
### **1️⃣ Excel Chart**
- Created a trendline for voltage data over time.

### **2️⃣ Python Chart**
- Used **Matplotlib & Seaborn** to replicate the Excel visualization.
- Applied a **5-day moving average**.
- Identified **voltage drops, peaks, and downward acceleration cycles**.
